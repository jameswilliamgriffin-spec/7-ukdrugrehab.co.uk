We’ll talk through whether our setting and support are right for you.",

  {
    question: "What happens after rehab?",

      "Before you leave, we’ll help you build a recovery plan for ongoing support, daily routines, relationships and relapse prevention. Recovery is a journey, and support shouldn’t simply end when your residential stay does.",
